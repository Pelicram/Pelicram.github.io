Howdy! My name is Otto and I'm a Typewriter Addict. This blog will be something of an outlet for me when I fall into different rabbit holes and find something I want to share with the Typosphere. 

The site is currently a bit barebones, eventually I'll add pages about my typewriters, and various ephemera including ribbons tins, manuals, brochures etc.

The name of the blog has been inspired by the famous advertizement slogans used by the Underwood Typewriter Company.
