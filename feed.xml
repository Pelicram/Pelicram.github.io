I saw many collectors, even seasoned veterans who were confused about which model their machine was. This guide a quick reference for that purpose, i’ll go into more detail about the differences and features in the main article.</p> <p>Continental portable typewriters were made under several different model names, mostly varying in the amount of features. The 200 is an ultraportable machine that doesn’t have much in common with the rest except for a few borrowed parts, all others fall under the same general family:</p> <ul> <li>Klein-Continental - “Normal” Model</li> <li>34/35/50 - Ultra-Budget Model</li> <li>340/350 - Budget Model</li> <li>100 - Luxury model</li> </ul> <p>By expanding the table below, you will find a comparison of the features of each model. This was compiled based on period advertisements, and observations of dozens of typewriters.</p> <div class="l-page-outset"> <details><summary>Expand Table</summary> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Model</th> <th>Bichrome</th> <th>Margin Release Lever</th> <th>Paper Guide</th> <th>Case Felt</th> <th>Left Platen Knob</th> <th>Margin Set Lever</th> <th>Tabulator</th> <th>Paper Support</th> <th>Years Made</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Klein</td> <td>Yes</td> <td>Yes</td> <td>~1933-&gt;</td> <td>Usually</td> <td>~1933-&gt;</td> <td>No</td> <td>Sometimes</td> <td>Usually</td> <td>1929-1947</td> </tr> <tr> <td>34</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>1933-1934</td> </tr> <tr> <td>35</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>1935-1937</td> </tr> <tr> <td>50</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>1937-1948</td> </tr> <tr> <td>340</td> <td>Sometimes</td> <td>Sometimes</td> <td>No</td> <td>Sometimes</td> <td>Sometimes</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>Unknown</td> </tr> <tr> <td>350</td> <td>Sometimes</td> <td>Sometimes</td> <td>No</td> <td>Sometimes</td> <td>Sometimes</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>Unknown</td> </tr> <tr> <td>100</td> <td>Yes</td> <td>Yes</td> <td>Yes</td> <td>Yes</td> <td>Yes</td> <td>Yes</td> <td>Yes</td> <td>No</td> <td>1938-194X</td> </tr> <tr> <td>200</td> <td>No</td> <td>Key</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>Yes</td> <td>No</td> <td>No</td> <td>Yes</td> <td>1939/1940-~1943</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </details> </div> <h2 id="the-guide">The Guide</h2> <p>Based on the findings above, I’ve created a flowchart to help you figure out which Continental model your machine may be. In most cases it is sufficient to look at the decals, but this procedure should help with those machines where they have been damaged.</p> <p>If you notice any mistakes in the guide, feature table, or have new information, please let me know.</p> <hr/> <div class="l-screen-inset"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/The-Typewriter-Blog-You-Will-Eventually-Read/assets/img/Klein-Continental%20Identification%20V1.0-480.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/The-Typewriter-Blog-You-Will-Eventually-Read/assets/img/Klein-Continental%20Identification%20V1.0-800.webp"/> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/The-Typewriter-Blog-You-Will-Eventually-Read/assets/img/Klein-Continental%20Identification%20V1.0-1400.webp"/> <img src="/The-Typewriter-Blog-You-Will-Eventually-Read/assets/img/Klein-Continental%20Identification%20V1.0.png" class="img-fluid rounded" width="auto" height="auto" data-zoomable="" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div>]]></content><author><name>Otto Koponen</name></author><category term="Typewriters"/><category term="continental"/><category term="guide"/><summary type="html"><![CDATA[Your guide to figuring out which model your Continental portable typewriter is.]]></summary></entry></feed>
