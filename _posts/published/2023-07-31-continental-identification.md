I've been working on an article about the history and changes through the years concerning the Continental portables, this is a sort of spin-off topic that i decided to cover after i started my research. I saw many collectors, even seasoned veterans who were confused about which model their machine was. This guide a quick reference for that purpose, i'll go into more detail about the differences and features in the main article.

Continental portable typewriters were made under several different model names, mostly varying in the amount of features. The 200 is an ultraportable machine that doesn't have much in common with the rest except for a few borrowed parts, all others fall under the same general family: 

- Klein-Continental - "Normal" Model
- 34/35/50 - Ultra-Budget Model
- 340/350 - Budget Model
- 100 - Luxury model

By expanding the table below, you will find a comparison of the features of each model. This was compiled based on period advertisements, and observations of dozens of typewriters.

## The Guide

Based on the findings above, I've created a flowchart to help you figure out which Continental model your machine may be. In most cases it is sufficient to look at the decals, but this procedure should help with those machines where they have been damaged.

If you notice any mistakes in the guide or have new information, please let me know.
