This is just a quick post to make available some information that I came across in a Finnish advertising brochure for the Mercedes Prima (K41) typewriter. In addition to showing a diagram of the Prima's features, it had a comparison list of features between the Prima, Superba and Selecta. I've translated the list into English and formatted it into a handy table. I've not seen this info listed anywhere before so I hope this will be useful to collectors and hobbyists.
